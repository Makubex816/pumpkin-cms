# Pumpkin Platform Active Blockers And Gates

## Current V2 Gate Summary

| Gate | Status | V2 refs | Required unblock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure staging foundation inventory and IaC package | Complete | V2.3.1 / L07 / L09 / L11 / L12 | No-deploy package created; no Azure mutation performed. |
| Azure staging creation and binding validation | Complete, blocked before mutation | V2.3.2 / L07 / L09 / L11 / L12 | V2.3.1 values were candidate/example-level; no resources created. |
| Azure staging final parameter worksheet and creation retry | Complete | V2.3.3 / L07 / L09 / L11 / L12 | Staging resource group and resource foundation created; RBAC skipped. |
| Azure staging RBAC/profile/OLM contract finalization | Complete | V2.3.4 / L07 / L08 / L09 / L11 / L12 | Staging DB-scoped Cosmos RBAC assigned; provider profile and Resource Registry candidates created; OLM contract passed. |
| First scoped OLM staging write gate | Complete | V2.2.2 / L08 / L12 | Approved batch `olbatch_b08e184fdc6565aa` wrote 48 records and passed readback. |
| OLM staging hardening/readback gate | Complete, partial stage-ready | V2.2.3 / L06 / L08 / L09 / L10 / L12 | Repeat readback/reconciliation passed; final signoff still needs staging-backed Admin/API bridge. |
| OLM real staging provider target | Seeded and readback-hardened for approved scoped batch | V2.2 / V2.3 / V2.5 | Keep `olm-staging-cosmos-nosql-v1` closed to additional writes until a new explicit approval. |
| OLM readback/rollback | Repeat readback passed; rollback plan preserved | V2.2 / V2.4 / V2.9 | Non-destructive rollback validation passed; rollback deletion was not executed. |
| Azure resource creation/mutation | Closed | V2.3 / L11 | Separate explicit approval required. |
| RBAC assignment | Complete for V2.3.4 staging database scope | V2.3 / L11 / L12 | Future RBAC changes require separate explicit approval. |
| Production database migration | Closed | V2.9 / L12 | Future explicit production migration approval only. |
| Production provider writes | Closed | V2.9 / L12 | Future explicit production write approval only. |
| CMS writes | Closed | L04 / L12 | Separate scoped approval required. |
| Deployment/indexing/publication | Closed | V2.8 / V2.9 / L15 | Separate deploy/index/publish approval required. |

## Remaining OLM Stage-Ready Gates

- Wire or validate Admin/API runtime against staging-backed read-only OLM state.
- Add or approve Backup Center staging upload/storage proof path without keys, connection strings, or SAS.
- Clear local API QA build-lock/stale assembly blocker and refresh API write-action QA.
- Keep `production-runtime` blocked and keep any additional `live-write-approved` operation scoped to a future explicit approval.
- Validate non-destructive rollback readiness without executing rollback deletion unless separately approved.
